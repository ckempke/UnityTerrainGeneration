# References

I'm not the first, or the fiftieth, or the five hundredth person to walk this path.  Here are references to others who have gone before or after me.   Because a lot of these are written by developer handles or other pseudonyms, please see the actual pages for author information.   (Yeah, yeah, I'm casual about my references.   No AP style here; this isn't being submitted for publication.   If you care about the details, go look at them!) 

[Polygonal Map Generation for Games](http://www-cs-students.stanford.edu/~amitp/game-programming/polygon-map-generation/) uses Voronoi diagrams to "lay out" biomes and elevations before filling them in with other techniques.   This is a fairly old article, and as such is extremely frequently referenced by the others.

This developer took that same technique a lot further, attempting to literally implement the stresses of continental plate interaction.  [Procedural Terrain Generation With Voronoi Diagrams](https://squeakyspacebar.github.io/2017/07/12/Procedural-Map-Generation-With-Voronoi-Diagrams.html)

A whole blog detailing one developer's descent into this rabbit hole:  [Fantasy Maps for fun and glory](https://azgaar.wordpress.com/).

Along the same lines, someone playing with not just the physical maps, but their political divisions, as well: [Generating fantasy maps](https://mewo2.com/notes/terrain/).

An implementation of the Marching Cubes algorithm using uUnity.   There are several of these available in your favorite search engine, but this ones had one of the most functional implementations as of the time I was looking.   I was originally planning on extending it for this project, but ultimately had sufficiently different requirements that it wasn't a good fit.  This is a github project reference, so it's code, not so much text.  [Marching-Cubes-Terrain](https://github.com/Eldemarkki/Marching-Cubes-Terrain)
