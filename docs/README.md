# Runtime Terrain Generation in Unity
I've always loved open world games, with their illusion of complete freedom of movement in a vast world ready for exploration.    And as a 
developer, I've similarly been a fan of _procedural generation_ of game environments: the notion that the game can--through application of rules--generate
it's own content.    In the best scenarios, this gives way to _emergent behavior_, in which those rules combine in ways that are more than the sum of their
parts, and can produce results (pleasantly) surprising even to the developer.

The logical endpoint of this are games like _No Man's Sky_, in which virtually the entire world is procedurally generated.

As a developer, one of the attractions of such systems is that a small team--perhaps even an individual--can create a "large" game in this way.   Since, despite what the
scale tells me, *I* am an individual, and I've now got time to look into projects like this, I'm combining an effort to learn the Unity game engine with a desire to push some
boundaries of procedural design.

Will this turn into something more than some musings on the web?   Who knows!   That's the wonder of it.
